# Input

[XInput](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/xinput/getting-started-with-xinput) is a Windows library that allows integration with controllers and gamepads that support the XInput protocol. The engine requires controllers and gamepads to support XInput; DirectInput and other proprietary protocols are not supported.
